# HybridModel_StockPrediction

The Hybrid model is a combination of the statistical model, Kalman filter and the machine learning model, XGBoost. Hybrid model aids in proper prediction of the stock values with increased accuracy and consistency across various datasets. Kalman filters are optimally used to estimate the variables of interests when they can't be measured directly, but an indirect measurement is available. For this indirect measurement fourteen parameters can be used. Using Feature Extraction, XGBoost Algorithm takes the top five parameters according to the weighted values among fourteen parameters. The top five parameters vary for different stocks. These five parameters are fed into Kalman filter, and the stock value is predicted for the required future date, and output is extracted.
